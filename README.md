# car_insurance_prediction

Imagine you are working for a car insurance company that has shared its annual car insurance data.
As a data scientist, your task is to analyze the dataset and build a predictive model to understand
customer behaviours. The ultimate goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to claim their car
insurance (1) or not (0). This insight can help the company make informed risk assessment and
customer engagement decisions.
